## Description  :clipboard:
* This is a budget tracker that users can use on the go, whether with internet access or not. All additions to the tracker while offline will populate when users come back online

### User Story
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling


### Business Context
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.

Created with JS, MongoDB/Mongoose, IndexedDB, HTMl, CSS and love :heart:.
